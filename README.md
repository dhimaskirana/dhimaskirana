## ðŸš€ About Me

Iâ€™m a web developer and designer born and living in [Yogyakarta, Indonesia](https://goo.gl/maps/4RJqywwc9breWFrZ8). I love technology, design, and music. You can follow my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dhimas.kirana/). I uploaded my music cover there.

I started getting to know WordPress in 2009. [This is](https://dhimaskirana.wordpress.com/) the first website that I created using WordPress. Then I learned blogging and how to make a website using self-hosted WordPress from 2009 until 2012. In 2012 I [created my first website](https://www.dhimaskirana.com/blog-baru-semangat-baru/) using self-hosted WordPress and a dot com domain.

Since having this website, then I have learned web design and how to develop WordPress themes. [This is](https://www.dhimaskirana.com/dk-themes-tersedia-di-wordpress/) my first theme in the WordPress theme repository that I uploaded in 2013. Then I [created another theme again](https://www.dhimaskirana.com/mahal-wordpress-themes/) in 2014.

In 2018 I graduated from college. Then my friend offered me a job as a presentation designer at a small New York company. He offered the job to me because he knew I could do design work.

I still work as a presentation designer and freelance as a WordPress Developer.

You can check my code on [my Github](https://github.com/dhimaskirana). If you want to see my design please check [my Behance](https://www.behance.net/dhimaskirana) or [my Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/dhimaskirana).
